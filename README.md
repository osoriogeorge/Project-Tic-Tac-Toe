## Introduction

Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with their symbol (either "X" or "O"). The goal is to get three of your symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) before the other player does.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Enter the names of Player 1 and Player 2 in the input fields.
3. Click the "Start Game" button.
4. Players take turns clicking on the empty squares to place their symbol.
5. The first player to get three in a row wins the game.
6. If all the squares are filled and no player has won, it's a tie.
7. Click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.
